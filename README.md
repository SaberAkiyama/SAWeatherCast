### HOW TO NO.1

Change the time format.
Some users accomplish how to change the time format. Here is how to work.

First, right-click on the current weather skin, hover "Custom skin menu,"
and click "Switch to 12 Hours" or "Switch to 24 Hours".
It's easy to depend on what you want in a 12-hour or 24-hour format.

&nbsp;

### HOW TO NO.2

Change to a different language.
Some users need clarification about different languages. Here is how to work.

First, right-click on the current weather skin, hover "Custom skin menu," and click "Open Settings panel."

Second, on the Settings skin, left-click the "Language" page on the left of a page tab.
There are 30 different languages, including three different English.
By default, English (US) is an Imperial format, English (GB) is a hybrid format, and English (World) is a Metric format. Other languages use the Metric format.
It depends on what your language is if you want.

Finally, after you pick a language, click "Apply Changes" to refresh a weather skin.
